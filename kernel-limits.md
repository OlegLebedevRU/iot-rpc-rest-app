# Operating System Kernel Limits

Most operating systems enforce limits on kernel resources: virtual memory, stack size, open file handles and more. To Linux users these limits can be known as "ulimit limits".

RabbitMQ nodes are most commonly affected by the maximum open file handle limit. Default limit value on most Linux distributions is usually 1024, which is very low for a messaging broker (or generally, any data service). See Deployment Guidelines for recommended values.

Modifying Limits
With systemd (Modern Linux Distributions)
On distributions that use systemd, the OS limits are controlled via a configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/rabbitmq-server.service.d/limits.conf. For example, to set the max open file handle limit (nofile) to 64000:

[Service]
LimitNOFILE=64000

See systemd documentation to learn about the supported limits and other directives.

With Docker
To configure kernel limits for Docker containers, use the "default-ulimits" key in Docker daemon configuration file. The file has to be installed on Docker hosts at /etc/docker/daemon.json:

`{
  "default-ulimits": {
    "nofile": {
      "Name": "nofile",
      "Hard": 64000,
      "Soft": 64000
    }
  }
}`
