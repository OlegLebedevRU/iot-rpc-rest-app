# MQTT topic rules
## Breaking

The rules are important. RabbitMQ definitions create restrictions on device access to topics based on device serial numbers. The serial numbers of the devices are embedded in the x509 certificate.

### Topic name template

Example topic name:

Mqtt received topic= <dev/a3b0000000c10221d290825/req>

_to RabbitMQ routing-key translate = "dev.a3b0000000c10221d290825.req"_

`Direction prefix = ["srv", "dev"]`
* srv - from SERVER to DEVICE

* evt - EVENT message from Device (not in RPC workflow)
* ack - acknowledge message for task init message
* req - from device request for get queued task
* res - send result after task complete

`Action suffix_2 = ["tsk", "rsp", "eva"]`
* tsk - immediate notify (without payload) message to device after task created
* rsp - from server response with task parameters (payload)
